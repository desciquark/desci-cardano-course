## Andamio â€“ Presented by SebastiÃ¡n PabÃ³n
**Andamio** is a platform that facilitates collaboration and contribution of massive groups of people in the framework of big projects. When the collective intelligence activated by groups of people turns on, the project improves its performance, and in doing so, the communities get their share of the benefits, in a project-people virtuous circle that feeds back positively. The facilitation of collective intelligence should not be underestimated: it is the basis of global liquid markets, and the reason why multinational companies like **Syngenta** (Andamio customer) are exploring it as a competitive advantage to engage their niche markets (e.g. farmers).
