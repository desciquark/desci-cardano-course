### 🔄 Recommendations & Next Steps

Based on feedback from event participants, course users, academics, speakers, and community members:

- 🌐 Expand curriculum with advanced topics (e.g. **Aiken**, **privacy tools with Midnight**)  
- 🏛 Build **physical hubs & in-person programs**: workshops, DeSci events, hackathons  
- 🧭 Maintain continuous accessibility: DeSci Quark will remain open and free  
- 📈 Promote, refine, and evolve the program as the DeSci ecosystem grows  

We are committed to keeping the educational content live, responsive, and contributing to the growth of Decentralized Science on Cardano.
