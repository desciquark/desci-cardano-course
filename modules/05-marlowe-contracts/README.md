# Module 5: Exploring Marlowe Smart Contracts

This module introduces participants to the fundamentals of smart contracts and their significance within blockchain technology. Special emphasis is placed on Marlowe, a domain-specific language built for accessibility, especially for those without programming experience.

Participants will learn how smart contracts work and discover why Marlowe is particularly well-suited for scientific use cases. Through practical exercises in the Marlowe Playground, they will design and simulate contracts that address real-world scientific challenges.
